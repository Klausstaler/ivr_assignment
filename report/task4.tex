\exercise[Joint State Estimation (4.1)]

\subsection{Description of the algorithm}
We use the algorithm described under \ref{joints_algo} to estimate the
3D coordinates of each of the joints.
We use our \texttt{fit\_theta1} method to optimise the error of fitting
our angles to the estimated 3D coordinates:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        For various "guesses" in the range of $[-\pi, \pi]$, let
        $\hat{\theta_1}$ be a guess for the first joint.
    \item
        "Undo" this guess by rotating around the Z-axis by $-\hat{\theta_1}$
    \item
        Estimate the angles for $\theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4$ using our
        previously described approach.
    \item
        Compute the positions of the \textbf{green} and \textbf{red}
        joint using forward kinematics, and \textbf{compute the error}
        between our 3D estimates and these locations.
    \item
        We let our estimate for $\theta_1$ be the angle which minimises
        the error described above.

\end{enumerate}
